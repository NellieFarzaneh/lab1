      <p>
        I'm a hands on UX-designer who loves exploring how people think, feel
        and interact with digital experiences. I enjoy turnning complex problems
        infor clear and intuitive solutions, as well as experimenting with ideas
        that make products feel enjoyable and engaging, and also looks good. I
        like to learn new things with pototyping, reseraching and everything in

      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <main>
        <p>
          When I was younger I lived in Skåne. There I studied animal health
          care. I chose this major as I have always had an interest and
          compassion for animals. I remember that I as a child always wanted to
          be around animals and was sad that my brother was allergic to fur
          animals, and was very jealous of friends and family members who had
          pets. My plan after Gymnasiet was to continue with animal related
          studies, such as veterinary medicine or animal welfare inspector.
          However, this meant I had to move to a city that I did not want to
          move to so after a lot of consideration I decided to start my IT
          journey as a interaction designer. I am currently studying my third,
          and last year, as an interaction designer at Linneus University in
          Kalmar. I found my interets for this program becuase of my boyfriend.
          When we met he was studying the same thing, and i was originally
          planning on studying economics. After seeing what my boyfriend did I
          was intrigued and started looking into the program myself. I found it
          very interesting and decided to apply.

      <h2>Interets</h2>
      <main>
        <p>
          During my free time I enjoy working out and being active. I like
          taking walks with friends and my boyfriend, and I like going to the
          gym to do strength training as well as cardio and pilates. I also like
          second hand shopping and going to thrift stores to find unique clothes
          and accessories. My new found hobby is crocheing. I find this very
          relaxing and rewarding as it gived me something meaningful to do as
          well as getting fun stuff to wear and use afterwards. I like the
          feeling of knowing I made it myself.

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <main>
        <p>
          My short term goal is to finish my studies and get my degree as an
          interaction designer. After that I would like to get a job within the
          field. I would like to work at a company with a sustainability focus.
          I would like my future working place to have a good work environment
          where I can learn and grow as a designer.
